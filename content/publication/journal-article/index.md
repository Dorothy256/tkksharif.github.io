abstract: Worldwide, the burden of Sickle Cell disease (SCD) has not been amply addressed. In Africa, Uganda has the 5th highest burden, a situation aggravated by limited and inaccessible formal social support structures to aid patients and families cope better with the psychosocial burden of SCD. In addition, this has been coupled with stigmatization and discrimination of people living with sickle cell disease causing isolation from family and society.
