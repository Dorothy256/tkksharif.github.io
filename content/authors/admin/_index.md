In 2013, Sharifu was identified to initiate and lead the [Uganda Sickle Cell Rescue Foundation](https://www.uscrfuganda.org/). A nonprofit organization formed with the aim of promoting awareness, sensitization and fighting sickle cell disease in Uganda.  Using his lived experiences, he advocated for people living with sickle cell disease to have rights to independent thinking, participate freely in community activities. He worked to address  the associated social stigma and construction around the general conceptualization of the disease in Uganda. Sharifu extended direct services to over 60,150 people, set up 10 support networks and registered 20,153 across Uganda.
