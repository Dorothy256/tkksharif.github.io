In 2013, Sharifu was identified to initiate and lead the Uganda Sickle Cell Rescue Foundation. A nonprofit organization formed with the aim of promoting awareness, sensitization and fighting sickle cell disease in Uganda.  He advocates for people living with sickle cell disease to have rights to independent thinking, participate freely in community activities or further agency as well as trying to address the associated social stigma and construction around the general conceptualization of the disease. Sharifu extended direct services to over 40,150 people, set up 10 support networks and registered 20,153 across Uganda.

In 2018, he was selected for the Telemachus Mentorship, under the Global Thinkers Forum in the United Kingdom.
