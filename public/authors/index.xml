      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Sharifu was identified to initiate and lead the Uganda Sickle Cell Rescue Foundation. A nonprofit organization formed with the aim of promoting awareness, sensitization and fighting sickle cell disease in Uganda.  He advocates for people living with sickle cell disease to have rights to independent thinking, participate freely in community activities or further agency as well as trying to address the associated social stigma and construction around the general conceptualization of the disease. Sharifu extended direct services to over 40,150 people, set up 10 support networks and registered 20,153 across Uganda.&lt;/p&gt;

 --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through his work, Sharifu has been able to receive numerous honors and awards; in 2017 he was selected for the prestigious Mandela Washington Fellowship a program run by the United States Department of State, where top young leaders are selected from across Africa for a professional development experience in the USA. In 2018, he was selected for the Telemachus Mentorship, under the Global Thinkers Forum in the United Kingdom. He also received the 2018 Clarke International University award for most outstanding community outreach.
Today, Sharifu advises on community transformation, sickle cell advocacy, and leads presentations and workshops for a wide range of audiences in his continued pursuit to contribute to youth development by linking science, community, creativity and commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
